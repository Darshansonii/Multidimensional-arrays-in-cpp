# Experiment: Multidimensional Array

## Aim

To implement various operations on multidimensional arrays (matrices), including:
- Taking matrix input from the user and displaying it
- Addition of two matrices
- Matrix multiplication
- Diagonal addition
- Matrix transpose
- Comparing elements of the first row with the second row

## Theory

### What is a Multidimensional Array?
A **multidimensional array** is an array of arrays. The most common form is the 2D array, which can be visualized as a matrix with rows and columns.

**Matrix operations are widely used** in data processing, computer graphics, engineering applications, and scientific computations.

### Key Concepts:

1. **Matrix Input/Output**  
   Reading and printing a 2D array.

2. **Matrix Addition**  
   Adding two matrices of the same size by summing corresponding elements.

3. **Matrix Multiplication**  
   Multiplying two matrices using the row-column rule.

4. **Diagonal Addition**  
   Summing the elements on the main diagonal (left-to-right) or secondary diagonal (right-to-left).

5. **Transpose of a Matrix**  
   Swapping rows with columns (i.e., `A[i][j]` becomes `A[j][i]`).

6. **Row Comparison**  
   Comparing elements in the first row with the corresponding elements in the second row.

## Software Used

- Programming Language: C / C++ / Java / Python (based on your course requirements)
- IDE or Code Editor (e.g., VS Code, Code::Blocks, PyCharm)
- Terminal/Command Prompt for execution

## Conclusion

In this experiment, we successfully implemented key matrix operations using multidimensional arrays. Understanding these operations helps in solving complex problems in linear algebra and forms the basis for more advanced topics such as image processing, machine learning, and data science. Through this exercise, we gained hands-on experience with nested loops and array manipulation techniques.
